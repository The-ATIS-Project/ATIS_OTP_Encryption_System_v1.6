# ATIS_OTP_Encryption_System_v1.6
Safe and private encription/decryption system. Creates an ATIS-KEY file which is used as a key to decrypt the original file. It is practically impossible to decrypt and open the original file without the key. All bits (0s and 1s) are switched randomly. OTP stands for One-Time-Pad. All files need to be in the same folder for the programm to work. There are detailed instructions in the .exe. Thank you for trusting and using ATIS Products...
